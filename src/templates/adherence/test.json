(18)].","base_prediction":-10.28,"context":"Over the last 20 years, major advances in cognitive neuroscience have clearly shown that the language function is not restricted into the classical language areas but it involves brain regions, which had never previously considered. Indeed, recent lines of evidence have suggested that the processing of words associated to motor schemata, such as action verbs, modulates the activity of the sensorimotor cortex, which, in turn, facilitates its retrieval. To date, no studies have investigated whether the spinal cord, which is functionally connected to the sensorimotor system, might also work as an auxiliary support for language processing. We explored the combined effect of transcutaneous spinal direct current stimulation (tsDCS) and language treatment in a randomized double-blind design for the recovery of verbs and nouns in 14 chronic aphasics. During each treatment, each subject received tsDCS (20 min, 2 mA) over the thoracic vertebrae (10th vertebra) in three different conditions: (1) anodic, (2) cathodic and (3) sham, while performing a verb and noun naming tasks. Each experimental condition was run in five consecutive daily sessions over 3 weeks. Overall, a significant greater improvement in verb naming was found during the anodic condition with respect to the other two conditions, which persisted at 1 week after the end of the treatment. No significant differences were present for noun naming among the three conditions. The hypothesis is advanced that anodic tsDCS might have influenced activity along the ascending somatosensory pathways, ultimately eliciting neurophysiological changes into the sensorimotor areas which, in turn, supported the retrieval of verbs. These results further support the evidence that action words, due to their sensorimotor semantic properties, are partly represented into the sensorimotor cortex. Moreover, they also document, for the first time, that tsDCS enhances verb recovery in chronic aphasia and it may represent a promising new tool for language treatment. see for example (2,3)] but it is also represented within regions that had never been considered before to support language [for review see Ref. (4)]. Accordingly, instead of considering the language faculty as completely modularized, behavioral and neuroimaging results have shown that the network subserving the language function is largely distributed across the brain (5,6). In the embodied cognition view, the representation of a concept is crucially dependent upon the sensory-motor properties belonging to that concept (7)(8)(9). Indeed, the hypothesis has been advanced that action verbs are mentally represented in different semantic representations among which the sensorimotor features to perform the action (10)(11)(12). This implies that the sensory-motor regions of the brain may also process action concepts. Several lines of evidence have already suggested that the sensorimotor cortex takes part in language processing, at least when speech is translated into sensorimotor acts (10,13,14).

To date, no studies have investigated whether the spinal cord, which is functionally connected to the sensorimotor system, might also work as an auxiliary support for language processing. We explored the combined effect of transcutaneous spinal direct current stimulation (tsDCS) and language treatment in a randomized double-blind design for the recovery of verbs and nouns in 14 chronic aphasics. During each treatment, each subject received tsDCS (20 min, 2 mA) over the thoracic vertebrae (10th vertebra) in three different conditions: (1) anodic, (2) cathodic and (3) sham, while performing a verb and noun naming tasks. Each experimental condition was run in five consecutive daily sessions over 3 weeks. Overall, a significant greater improvement in verb naming was found during the anodic condition with respect to the other two conditions, which persisted at 1 week after the end of the treatment. No significant differences were present for noun naming among the three conditions. The hypothesis is advanced that anodic tsDCS might have influenced activity along the ascending somatosensory pathways, ultimately eliciting neurophysiological changes into the sensorimotor areas which, in turn, supported the retrieval of verbs. These results further support the evidence that action words, due to their sensorimotor semantic properties, are partly represented into the sensorimotor cortex.

We explored the combined effect of transcutaneous spinal direct current stimulation (tsDCS) and language treatment in a randomized double-blind design for the recovery of verbs and nouns in 14 chronic aphasics.

To date, no studies have investigated whether the spinal cord, which is functionally connected to the sensorimotor system, might also work as an auxiliary support for language processing. We explored the combined effect of transcutaneous spinal direct current stimulation (tsDCS) and language treatment in a randomized double-blind design for the recovery of verbs and nouns in 14 chronic aphasics. During each treatment, each subject received tsDCS (20 min, 2 mA) over the thoracic vertebrae (10th vertebra) in three different conditions: (1) anodic, (2) cathodic and (3) sham, while performing a verb and noun naming tasks.

Overall, a significant greater improvement in verb naming was found during the anodic condition with respect to the other two conditions, which persisted at 1 week after the end of the treatment.

The hypothesis is advanced that anodic tsDCS might have influenced activity along the ascending somatosensory pathways, ultimately eliciting neurophysiological changes into the sensorimotor areas which, in turn, supported the retrieval of verbs.

The most extensively evaluated delivery instrument for this purpose is Health Risk Appraisal (HRA). This article describes a trial using HRA to evaluate the effect on health behaviour and preventative-care uptake in older people in NHS primary care. Methods: a randomised controlled trial was undertaken in three London primary care group practices. Functionally independent community-dwelling patients older than 65 years (n = 2,503) received a self-administered Health Risk Appraisal for Older Persons (HRA-O) questionnaire leading to computer-generated individualised written feedback to participants and general practitioners (GPs), integrated into practice information-technology (IT) systems. All primary care staff received training in preventative health in older people. The main outcome measures were self-reported health behaviour and preventative care uptake at 1-year follow-up. Results: of 2,503 individuals randomised, 2,006 respondents (80.1%) (intervention, n = 940, control n = 1,066) were available for analysis. Intervention group respondents reported slightly higher pneumococcal vaccination uptake and equivocal improvement in physical activity levels compared with controls.

The most extensively evaluated delivery instrument for this purpose is Health Risk Appraisal (HRA). This article describes a trial using HRA to evaluate the effect on health behaviour and preventative-care uptake in older people in NHS primary care. Methods: a randomised controlled trial was undertaken in three London primary care group practices. Functionally independent community-dwelling patients older than 65 years (n = 2,503) received a self-administered Health Risk Appraisal for Older Persons (HRA-O) questionnaire leading to computer-generated individualised written feedback to participants and general practitioners (GPs), integrated into practice information-technology (IT) systems. All primary care staff received training in preventative health in older people. The main outcome measures were self-reported health behaviour and preventative care uptake at 1-year follow-up. Results: of 2,503 individuals randomised, 2,006 respondents (80.1%) (intervention, n = 940, control n = 1,066) were available for analysis. Intervention group respondents reported slightly higher pneumococcal vaccination uptake and equivocal improvement in physical activity levels compared with controls. No significant differences were observed for any other categories of health behaviour or preventative care measures at 1-year follow-up. Conclusions: HRA-O implemented in this way resulted in minimal improvement of health behaviour or uptake of preventative care measures in older people. Supplementary reinforcement involving contact by health professionals with patients over and above routine clinical encounters may be a prerequisite to the effectiveness of IT-based delivery systems for health promotion in older people.","intervention":"Health Risk Appraisal (HRA)","section":"Abstract"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-06-30T14:23:52.529939Z","updated_at":"2022-06-30T14:27:49.091231Z","inner_id":402,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"project":1,"updated_by":1},{"id":401,"annotations":[{"id":401,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["0"]},"id":"48CT5M-4Ov","from_name":"adherence","to_name":"adherence","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2022-06-30T14:27:47.824138Z","updated_at":"2022-06-30T14:27:47.824159Z","lead_time":0.943,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"task":401,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null}],"file_upload":"1507cec2-2022-06-30-unlabeled.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"document_id":"engelbertink-2021.pdf","sentence":"However, little quantitative research is currently available regarding the effects of PT on perceived persuasiveness and involvement in an educational setting (Engelbertink et al., 2020b(Engelbertink et al., , 2020a.","base_prediction":-1.9,"context":"The current research used blended learning methods for critical reflection and autobiographical reflexivity.

However, little quantitative research is currently available regarding the effects of PT on perceived persuasiveness and involvement in an educational setting (Engelbertink et al., 2020b(Engelbertink et al., , 2020a.","intervention":"autobiographical reflexivity and persuasive technology (PT)","section":"Introduction"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-06-30T14:23:52.529630Z","updated_at":"2022-06-30T14:27:36.525551Z","inner_id":393,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"project":1,"updated_by":1},{"id":392,"annotations":[{"id":392,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["0"]},"id":"Jp_ZZqWz_7","from_name":"adherence","to_name":"adherence","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2022-06-30T14:27:34.208724Z","updated_at":"2022-06-30T14:27:34.208739Z","lead_time":2.937,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"task":392,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null}],"file_upload":"1507cec2-2022-06-30-unlabeled.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"document_id":"engelbertink-2021.pdf","sentence":"The focus groups showed that due to autobiographical reflexivity, students had more intrinsic motivation for online homework; there was enhanced discussion and questions throughout the lessons; and students were more interested in each other thus learnt more about one another's lives.","base_prediction":-1.6,"context":"The aim of this study was to assess the added value of autobiographical reflexivity (with PT) for the development of PI within a group of Social Work students.

In retrospect, this decision was unfortunate, since it left us unable to confirm a conclusion suggested by our findings: that a large proportion of children already had at least some knowledgeand some a firm graspof the structure of complex yes\/no questions before the study began.","intervention":"training children on complex noun phrases","section":". 3 . s t a n d a r d i s e d t e s t"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-06-30T14:23:52.528113Z","updated_at":"2022-06-30T14:24:19.698071Z","inner_id":348,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"project":1,"updated_by":1},{"id":347,"annotations":[{"id":347,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["0"]},"id":"Im7zM91NgN","from_name":"adherence","to_name":"adherence","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2022-06-30T14:24:08.474226Z","updated_at":"2022-06-30T14:24:08.474242Z","lead_time":0.975,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"task":347,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null}],"file_upload":"1507cec2-2022-06-30-unlabeled.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"document_id":"ambridge-2020.pdf","sentence":"and either (Experimental group, N = 61) complex noun phrases (e.g., the bird who's sad) or (Control group, N = 61) matched simple noun","base_prediction":-0.1,"context":"[ACTION]ing?) to yield a complex-question schema (Is [the [THING] who's [PROPERTY] ] ACTIONing?).

Magnesium sulfate has been shown to have a protective effect on BBB integrity in multiple experimental models. In this study we determine whether magnesium sulfate administration could have any protective effects on BBB derangement in a rat model of sepsis. Methods This randomized controlled experimental study was performed on adult male Sprague-Dawley rats. Intraperitoneal sepsis was induced by using the infected fibrin-thrombin clot model. To examine the effect of magnesium in septic and sham-operated rats, a dose of 750 µmol\/kg magnesium sulfate was given intramuscularly immediately after surgery. Control groups for both infected and shamoperated rats were injected with equal volume of saline. Those rats surviving for 24 hours were anesthetized and decapitated for the investigation of brain tissue specific gravity and BBB integrity by the spectrophotometric assay of Evans blue dye extravasations. Another set of experiments was performed for hemodynamic measurements and plasma magnesium level analysis. Rats were allocated into four parallel groups undergoing identical procedures. Results Sepsis significantly increased BBB permeability to Evans blue. The dye content of each hemisphere was significantly lower in the magnesium-treated septic rats (left hemisphere, 0.00218 ± 0.0005; right hemisphere, 0.00199 ± 0.0007 [all results are means ± standard deviation]) than in control septic animals (left hemisphere, 0.00466 ± 0.0002; right hemisphere, 0.00641 ± 0.0003). In septic animals treated with magnesium sulfate, specific gravity was higher (left hemisphere, 1.0438 ± 0.0007; right hemisphere, 1.0439 ± 0.0004) than in the untreated septic animals (left hemisphere, 1.0429 ± 0.0009; right hemisphere, 1.0424 ± 0.0012), indicating less edema formation with the administration of magnesium.

Another set of experiments was performed for hemodynamic measurements and plasma magnesium level analysis. Rats were allocated into four parallel groups undergoing identical procedures. Results Sepsis significantly increased BBB permeability to Evans blue. The dye content of each hemisphere was significantly lower in the magnesium-treated septic rats (left hemisphere, 0.00218 ± 0.0005; right hemisphere, 0.00199 ± 0.0007 [all results are means ± standard deviation]) than in control septic animals (left hemisphere, 0.00466 ± 0.0002; right hemisphere, 0.00641 ± 0.0003). In septic animals treated with magnesium sulfate, specific gravity was higher (left hemisphere, 1.0438 ± 0.0007; right hemisphere, 1.0439 ± 0.0004) than in the untreated septic animals (left hemisphere, 1.0429 ± 0.0009; right hemisphere, 1.0424 ± 0.0012), indicating less edema formation with the administration of magnesium. A significant decrease in plasma magnesium levels was observed 24 hours after the induction of sepsis. The dose of magnesium that we used maintained the baseline plasma magnesium levels in magnesium-treated septic rats. Conclusions Magnesium administration attenuated the increased BBB permeability defect and caused a reduction in brain edema formation in our rat model of intraperitoneal sepsis.","intervention":"magnesium sulfate","section":"Abstract"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-06-29T20:26:54.446176Z","updated_at":"2022-06-29T20:32:04.418066Z","inner_id":81,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"project":1,"updated_by":1},{"id":80,"annotations":[{"id":80,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["0"]},"id":"Tx0u4KO25J","from_name":"adherence","to_name":"adherence","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2022-06-29T20:32:03.577268Z","updated_at":"2022-06-29T20:32:03.577287Z","lead_time":1.094,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"task":80,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null}],"file_upload":"e8190320-unlabeled_rows.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"document_id":"esen-2004.pdf","sentence":"To examine the effect of magnesium in septic and sham-operated rats, a dose of 750 µmol\/kg magnesium sulfate was given intramuscularly immediately after surgery.","base_prediction":-1.88,"context":"Introduction Permeability changes in the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and their possible contribution to brain edema formation have a crucial role in the pathophysiology of septic encephalopathy.

One study investigated this issue in the assessment of the quality of life of cancer patients [9]. The participants selfadministered a questionnaire in which the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Core Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) preceded the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy -General (FACT-G). The two instruments contained similar questions on four aspects of HRQoL, namely, pain, nausea, meeting family needs, and general satisfaction.

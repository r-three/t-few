Objective: The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate the impact of a 5 week off-campus structured, yet unsupervised, break from regular training in top collegiate tennis players. Methods: A nationally ranked collegiate NCAA Division I male tennis team (n = 8) performed a test battery in December and again in January after a 5 week period of recommended, yet unsupervised, training. The tests performed were 5, 10 and 20 m sprints, spider agility test, medicine ball power throws, standing long jump, Wingate anaerobic power test, VO 2max , push-up and sit-up test, grip strength and range of motion (ROM) measures (goniometer) of the shoulder, hip, hamstring and quadriceps. Results: Paired t tests (p,0.05) showed significant decreases in mean (SEM) Wingate power measurements in Watts\/kg (pre: 8.35 (0.19) w\/kg ; post: 7.80 (0.24) w\/kg ), minimum Wingate power (pre: 5.89 (0.27) w\/kg; post: 5.10 (0.38) w\/kg) and VO 2max values (pre: 53.90 (1.11) ml\/kg\/min; post: 47.86 (1.54) ml\/kg\/min). A significant increase was seen in the athlete's fatigue index (pre: 44.26 (2.85)%; post: 51.41 (3.53)%), fastest 5 m (pre: 1.07 (0.03) s; post: 1.12 (0.02) s), 10 m (pre: 1.79 (0.03) s; post: 1.84 (0.04) s) and 20 m (pre: 3.07 (0.05) s; post: 3.13 (0.05) s) sprint times.

Methods: A nationally ranked collegiate NCAA Division I male tennis team (n = 8) performed a test battery in December and again in January after a 5 week period of recommended, yet unsupervised, training. The tests performed were 5, 10 and 20 m sprints, spider agility test, medicine ball power throws, standing long jump, Wingate anaerobic power test, VO 2max , push-up and sit-up test, grip strength and range of motion (ROM) measures (goniometer) of the shoulder, hip, hamstring and quadriceps. Results: Paired t tests (p,0.05) showed significant decreases in mean (SEM) Wingate power measurements in Watts\/kg (pre: 8.35 (0.19) w\/kg ; post: 7.80 (0.24) w\/kg ), minimum Wingate power (pre: 5.89 (0.27) w\/kg; post: 5.10 (0.38) w\/kg) and VO 2max values (pre: 53.90 (1.11) ml\/kg\/min; post: 47.86 (1.54) ml\/kg\/min). A significant increase was seen in the athlete's fatigue index (pre: 44.26 (2.85)%; post: 51.41 (3.53)%), fastest 5 m (pre: 1.07 (0.03) s; post: 1.12 (0.02) s), 10 m (pre: 1.79 (0.03) s; post: 1.84 (0.04) s) and 20 m (pre: 3.07 (0.05) s; post: 3.13 (0.05) s) sprint times. No significant differences were seen for the other variables tested. Conclusions: These results suggest that a 5 week interruption of normal training can result in significant reductions in speed, power and aerobic capacity in competitive tennis players, likely owing to poor compliance with the prescribed training regimen. Therefore, coaches and trainers might benefit from techniques (eg, pre-and post-testing) requiring athletes' to have accountability for unsupervised workouts.","prediction":0.02,"sentence":"Background: All competitive tennis players take time away from coaches throughout the year; however, little information is available as to the short-term physiological effect of these breaks.","section":"Abstract"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-06-14T18:52:43.882256Z","updated_at":"2022-06-14T19:16:25.312403Z","inner_id":324,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"project":1,"updated_by":1},{"id":323,"annotations":[{"id":323,"completed_by":1,"result":[],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2022-06-14T19:16:13.817026Z","updated_at":"2022-06-14T19:16:13.817056Z","lead_time":6.598,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"task":323,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null}],"file_upload":"3bda059d-label_data.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"paper":"golding-2018.pdf","intervention":"prenatal mercury exposure","context":"In this large birth cohort study with prospectively collected information, we found no evidence to suggest that prenatal exposure to total maternal blood Hg, measured Note that overall the percentage of extreme autistic traits varies-it is as near to 10% as possible directly in whole blood, and indirectly through fish consumption and dental amalgam fillings, was associated with autism or increased autism symptoms in the offspring.","prediction":0.23,"sentence":"In this large birth cohort study with prospectively collected information, we found no evidence to suggest that prenatal exposure to total maternal blood Hg, measured Note that overall the percentage of extreme autistic traits varies-it is as near to 10% as possible directly in whole blood, and indirectly through fish consumption and dental amalgam fillings, was associated with autism or increased autism symptoms in the offspring.","section":"Discussion"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-06-14T18:52:43.882222Z","updated_at":"2022-06-14T19:16:13.845975Z","inner_id":323,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"project":1,"updated_by":1},{"id":322,"annotations":[{"id":322,"completed_by":1,"result":[],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2022-06-14T19:16:07.051999Z","updated_at":"2022-06-14T19:16:07.052015Z","lead_time":9.676,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"task":322,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null}],"file_upload":"3bda059d-label_data.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"paper":"golding-2018.pdf","intervention":"prenatal mercury exposure","context":"Background: Mercury (Hg) has been suspected of causing autism in the past, especially a suspected link with vaccinations containing thiomersal, but a review of the literature shows that has been largely repudiated.

This is the largest longitudinal study to date to have tested this hypothesis and the only one to have considered early pregnancy. Methods: We have used three strategies: (1) direct comparison of 45 pregnancies resulting in children with diagnosed autism from a population of 3840, (2) comparison of high scores on each of the four autistic traits within the population at risk (n~2800), and (3) indirect measures of association of these outcomes with proxies for increased Hg levels such as frequency of fish consumption and exposure to dental amalgam (n > 8000). Logistic regression adjusted for social conditions including maternal age, housing circumstances, maternal education, and parity. Interactions were tested between risks to offspring of fish and non-fish eaters. Results: There was no suggestion of an adverse effect of total prenatal blood Hg levels on diagnosed autism (AOR 0.89; 95% CI 0.65, 1.22) per SD of Hg (P = 0.485). The only indication of adverse effects concerned a measure of poor social cognition when the mother ate no fish, where the AOR was 1.63 [95% CI 1.02, 2.62] per SD of Hg (P = 0.041), significantly different from the association among the offspring of fish-eaters (AOR = 0.74 [95% CI 0.41, 1.35]).","prediction":0.01,"sentence":"Background: Mercury (Hg) has been suspected of causing autism in the past, especially a suspected link with vaccinations containing thiomersal, but a review of the literature shows that has been largely repudiated.","section":"Abstract"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-06-14T18:52:43.881914Z","updated_at":"2022-06-14T19:15:47.997569Z","inner_id":314,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"project":1,"updated_by":1},{"id":313,"annotations":[{"id":313,"completed_by":1,"result":[],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2022-06-14T19:15:38.688070Z","updated_at":"2022-06-14T19:15:38.688104Z","lead_time":8.6,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"task":313,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null}],"file_upload":"3bda059d-label_data.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"paper":"golding-2018.pdf","intervention":"prenatal mercury exposure","context":"On the other hand, this study provides a number of advantages: (a) it is based on a geographic population with a high enrolment rate (~80%) and consequently may be more generalizable to areas with similar distributions of blood Hg among pregnant women; (b) a relatively large number of confounders were available to be taken into account, thus diminishing the likelihood of bias in the results; (c) the prenatal data were collected prospectively with no knowledge as to how the child would develop, again reducing the likelihood of possible bias; and (d) sufficient numbers were available to allow comparison between offspring of fish and non-fish consumers for autistic traits (although not for diagnosed autism).","prediction":0.52,"sentence":"On the other hand, this study provides a number of advantages: (a) it is based on a geographic population with a high enrolment rate (~80%) and consequently may be more generalizable to areas with similar distributions of blood Hg among pregnant women; (b) a relatively large number of confounders were available to be taken into account, thus diminishing the likelihood of bias in the results; (c) the prenatal data were collected prospectively with no knowledge as to how the child would develop, again reducing the likelihood of possible bias; and (d) sufficient numbers were available to allow comparison between offspring of fish and non-fish consumers for autistic traits (although not for diagnosed autism).","section":"Strengths and limitations"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-06-14T18:52:43.881880Z","updated_at":"2022-06-14T19:15:38.719700Z","inner_id":313,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"project":1,"updated_by":1},{"id":312,"annotations":[{"id":312,"completed_by":1,"result":[],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2022-06-14T19:15:29.908214Z","updated_at":"2022-06-14T19:15:29.908244Z","lead_time":0.461,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"task":312,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null}],"file_upload":"3bda059d-label_data.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"paper":"routledge-2006.pdf","intervention":"sulphur dioxide exposure, carbon particle exposure","context":"Pure carbon particles were produced by a spark discharge aerosol generator (GFG-1000; Palas GmbH, Karlsruhe, Germany).

Pupils in the parasitological subsample who were found to be infected with schistosomiasis, but attended schools that did not qualify for mass treatment with praziquantel, were individually treated. However, there were few such pupils: the proportion of moderate-to-heavy schistosomiasis among the thirty-four schools that fell below the 30 percent threshold in 1999 was just 0.02. 14  In 1998, pupils received 600 mg albendazole doses during each round of treatment, following the protocol of an earlier Government of Kenya Ministry of Health deworming project in Kwale District; in 1999, pupils were treated with 400 mg albendazole (WHO (1992)).

There are also no significant long-run impacts on earnings or job satisfaction. In particular, the impact on earning of the transport subsidy is about ten times smaller than that of the workshop, a difference which is significant at the 5 percent level. Finally, we document that individuals in the transport intervention group are about 6.3 percentage points less likely to be in employment. This effect is significant at the 10 percent level, but is not robust to the correction for multiple comparisons and we thus do not interpret it further.","prediction":0.37,"sentence":"We also find that the gains from the transport subsidy have dissipated after the first endline survey.","section":"Long-run impacts"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-06-14T18:52:43.870678Z","updated_at":"2022-06-14T19:04:01.889427Z","inner_id":132,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"project":1,"updated_by":1},{"id":128,"annotations":[{"id":128,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["adherence"]},"id":"jM9s3dkaww","from_name":"sentiment","to_name":"sentence","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2022-06-14T19:03:39.001487Z","updated_at":"2022-06-14T19:03:39.001516Z","lead_time":19.989,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"task":128,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null}],"file_upload":"3bda059d-label_data.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"paper":"abebe-2018.pdf","intervention":"transport subsidy","context":"Take-up is substantial for both treatments. 50% of individuals in the transport group collect the cash at least once.

A second source of concern is that not all participants complete the program. If only a select few complete the program, then evaluating program outcomes on the basis of comparisons between non-participants and participants who complete a program may lead to misleading inferences. Our examination of the administrative records shows that while it is not negligible, the dropout rate is not particularly high and that 87% of those who start do complete. This should not be surprising as the training program lasts for 3 months. With this background in mind and given the data at hand, there are two approaches that may be used to assess the impact of the DDUGKY. First, we propose to rely only on the current (post-training) outcomes and estimate the effect of having received training on employment and earnings (y i ), after controlling for individual and household characteristics. That is, where is the coefficient of interest. We estimate (2) using OLS and explore the sensitivity of the estimates to alternative estimators such as propensity score matching inverse probability weighting and instrumental variable (IV) estimation. In the case of all three alternatives, the first-step involves estimation of the probability of participation based on (1). 20  The use of a control group as discussed above to account for selection on unobservables and the use of statistical methods to control for differences in observables is likely to yield credible estimates. However, it is still possible that those who joint the program and completed it are different in terms of their unobserved characteristics as compared to who did not join the scheme. For instance, participants who join and complete may be more motivated or more able which may also affect their chances of finding employment and may lead to inflated estimates of program effects on outcomes. While the direction of the bias is not always clear, it is possible that, Cov DDUGKY i , i ≠ 0.","prediction":0.18,"sentence":"Given the voluntary nature of the DDUGKY, there are two key econometric issues which require discussion while attempting to identify its impact.","section":"Impact of DDUGKY"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-06-14T18:52:43.869816Z","updated_at":"2022-06-14T19:02:45.275170Z","inner_id":108,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"project":1,"updated_by":1},{"id":107,"annotations":[{"id":107,"completed_by":1,"result":[],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2022-06-14T19:02:34.584930Z","updated_at":"2022-06-14T19:02:34.584962Z","lead_time":0.529,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"task":107,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null}],"file_upload":"3bda059d-label_data.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"paper":"chakravorty-bedy-2019.pdf","intervention":"DDUGKY skills training programs","context":"Tables 5 and 6 provide information on the impact of the training program on employment and earnings.

In India, 54% of the country's population is below the age of 25 and faces a high rate of (disguised) unemployment. To augment youth employment, the Government of India has launched a number of skills training programs. This paper deals with participation in and the impact of one of these programs [Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Grameen Kaushal Yojana (DDUGKY)] located in rural Bihar, one of India's poorest states. The analysis is based on data collected in mid-2016 and compares trained participants with non-participants who applied for the scheme but eventually did not attend. We find that the training program squarely reaches the intended target group-rural poor youth. Initially, the program leads to a 29 percentage point increase in the employment rate of the trained graduates.

Shortly after contract signing, 1AF informed farmers about the study, that their participation would be voluntary, and further provided them with informed consent documents. 1AF informed farmers that half of them would be randomly assigned to treatment, while the other half would receive an alternative compensation package (household goods and a discount for 1AF participation the following season amounting to roughly 20% of the typical program cost). Randomization was conducted by public lottery, and all farmers enrolled in the study also received 10,000 Ksh in funeral insurance coverage, regardless of treatment status. 3 The study is complicated by the fact that it took place in a region where 1AF has already operated for several years. The specific villages selected for study inclusion had never been offered the 1AF program, but neighboring villages had previously been offered the program. Thus, a substantial portion of farmers who expressed interest in participating had previously participated in the 1AF program (by \"commuting\" to the neighboring villages to participate). 1AF typically targets smallholder farmers living in areas with 100-500 people per km 2 , who rely mostly on agricultural income, but who have limited access to farm inputs. Therefore, when 1AF decided to conduct an RCT to evaluate their work in Kenya, choosing completely new regions would have forced them to expand into regions that are quite unrepresentative of the typical program. For example, they would have had to enroll farmers in pre-dominantly tea-growing areas, or located in substantially different agro-ecological zones.
